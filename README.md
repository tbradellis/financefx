MMF/MVF - Asset Allocation and Balance Sheet
Not much novel with this first MMF. However...

Desktop application for viewing charted data in a tab based on a current asset allocation spreadsheet I'm using.
Current spreadsheet has account and amounts.  Most standard financial/budgeting software options do a poor job of presenting
household financial positions in the way that I think about them.  Some personal apps to a decent job, but often fail when it comes to 
viewing liabilities and assets in a combined view.

This app will seek to present household financial data in a way that encourages a more nuanced understanding of finances for the household.
